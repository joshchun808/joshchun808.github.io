**BrowserHistory 6, SmartPhoneProducts1_variables, Invoice1**
SmartPhoneProducts1_variables had you take your SmartPhoneProducs file from the labs and convert all of the phone data (i.e. name, price, image) to variables. For this WOD I was able to finish it in 17 minutes with 1 attempt. Like I had mentioned with the previous WODs if you have a decent understanding of what is covered in class then this should be pretty simple since you are just putting in a bunch of var commands. The thing that takes the longes on this WOD is just having to find all of your code for each variable (i.e. name, price, image) and having to constantly scroll up and down while copying and pasting. BrowserHistory 6 had you take your previous browser history and reformat it by creating buttons where the page index used to be and separating the different histories into their own page. For this WOD I took 21 minutes and 1 attempt. This one was simple as well since it uses the onclick and onmouseover commands that were covered in the lab. It also gives the code that is needed to create the buttons. For the most part, it's just copying and pasting code with slight tweaking to adjust the path (i.e. changing firefox to chrome so you don't have two firefoxes). One issue I had with this WOD was that I wasn't able to get images to pop up in the box when you moused over the buttons. But after a few minutes of fiddling around, I found it was just a spelling error in the code. Again, since it's just copying and pasting it should be pretty simple, I think on that part I ended up trying it myself and that led to the spelling error. Invoice1 had you create an invoice using variables. I finished this one in 40 minutes on my first attempt and 21 minutes on my second attempt. Again this one was relatively easy, but I did 2 attempts because I got a little confused with the instructions and my code started to get a little messy but still worked, but I wanted to try again and clean it up. Something that I did that created the mess was instead of making the sub cost, tax, and total variables I was just adding them up in a document.write in the table instead. As you can imagine it got really long and messy. After I re-read through the instructions I noticed that it wanted all of that to be as variables. So I decided to redo it making them variables and it made it a lot simpler. For further details about the WODs look at the links below.
