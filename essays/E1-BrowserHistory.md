**Quick Tips**
- Narrate your WOD videos
- Read the assignment first and prep refrince material before starting
- Check spelling of code
- Make sure you are editing the right file

**The most important tip** is to narrait what you are doing during your recording. While it says it nowhere in the instructions (at least to my recollection), you are supposed to. If not then you need to go and redue the entire WOD (or WODs if you already did them all) again just to get a new recording with a narration. 

For the first BrowserHistory although it was recommended to start by watching the screencast I had decided to try and jump right in to test my knowledge. I mangaed to finish in around 16 or 18 miniutes. I feel that as long as you are able to follow along with most of what goes on in class and do the reedings it should be relitivly easy to figure out what to do without wathiching the screencast before. Also a few tips to make it a bit easier is, before you start read what the WOD is asking for and if you are unsure what what code is needed for a sertain part then pull up the reference matrial before hand, that way while doing it you can just jusmp stright to the reference content without spending the time to search for it. Also, an important thing I learned from the first check your spelling, one wrong letter will drive you crasy trying to figure out what is wrong. The second BrowserHistory was basicaly the same, if you undersand most of the content and prepair any needed reference matirial than if should be fine. What I learned from the third BrowserHistory is to make sure you are editing the right file, since you are copying the fiels from the previous BrowserHistorys make sure you are on the right file or you might spend a lot of time wondering why your changes aren't going through.
