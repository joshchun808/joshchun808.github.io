My name is Joshua Chun. I am currently in my 3rd year of college with this being my first year at Shidler. After highschool I spent two years working trying to find a career that I would be interested in. First I worked at KCC in their culinary apprentiship program for a year and found that unlike the other people in the program I didn't have a true passion for it and decided to quit. After that I had worked in HVAC (air conditioning) for a year, but as work slowed down I ended up being laied off and finding that I had no passion for heavy labor jobs I decided to go back to school and get a degree in business. Since I had always been good at math and working with numbers I had started out with a focus in accounting at KCC, but after taking accounting courses I found that accounting wasn't for me and decided to change my major when I transfered to UH Manoa. When I transfted I was unsure about what specific area to major in but still wanted to keep it in the field of business. Since I had an interest in technology my cousin had recommended that I major in MIS since that was what he had majored in.
